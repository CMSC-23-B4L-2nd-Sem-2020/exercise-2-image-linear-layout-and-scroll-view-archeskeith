        \n\nBut, on the last day of the spring holidays before school started, a spacequake wrecked the town and a girl in armor appeared in front of him.
        \n\nShido adoptive sister, Kotori, tells him that the girl is a "Special Disasterous Designated Creature: Spirit," which caused the spacequakes and revealed that she was the commander of the organization that dealt with Spirits, and ordered him to go out on a date with the Spirit in order to pacify her.
